* changes to hunchentoot-auth 0.1

* session-user and session-user-authenticated-p have been replaced
  with session-realm-user and session-realm-user-authenticated-p now
  take arguments for the realm. This means that a user can be "logged
  in" in one hunchentoot session for one realm, but not logged in for
  another realm in the same server/session, or that a user could be
  logged into each realm with different user names.
* realm authentication stuff now works properly so that one can have
  multiple realms active on the same server. For instance, one may
  have two nuclblog blogs, each with its own realm for user/password
  information and the ht-auth stuff now works properly in this case.
