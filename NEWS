* changes to hunchentoot-auth 0.1

* session-user and session-user-authenticated-p have been replaced
  with session-realm-user and session-realm-user-authenticated-p now
  take arguments for the realm. This means that a user can be "logged
  in" in one hunchentoot session for one realm, but not logged in for
  another realm in the same server/session, or that a user could be
  logged into each realm with different user names.
